# todolist
Basic web extension for google chrome that changes your default new tab to have a decent to do list. 

The only thing that I can really even think of thats left to do is use more wallpapers. That is literally it. 

To Do:
4. Change how the check box looks when its checked off to look more like momentum
5. Add a "finished" tasks, and along with, find some way of adding instanced of finished "repeated" tasks. With this list, there should be a "undo" button, that once pressed, readds the item to the list. 
6. Getting the x icon working, and have that be labeled "finished" tasks and the garbage ones actually being deleted. 
8. Consider how keyboard behavior might affect to do list things.
10. Make overdue tasks red and in "due today" 
11. Make the quote thing easy to get rid of in settings
