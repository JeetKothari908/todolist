# todolist
Basic web extension for google chrome that changes your default new tab to have a decent to do list. 

The only thing that I can really even think of thats left to do is use more wallpapers. That is literally it. 

To Do:
3. Use more wallpapers
4. Change how the check box looks when its checked off to look more like momentum
5. Add a "finished" tasks, and along with, find some way of adding instanced of finished "repeated" tasks. With this list, there should be a "undo" button, that once pressed, readds the item to the list. 
6. Getting the x icon working, and have that be labeled "finished" tasks and the garbage ones actually being deleted. 
7. Figure out how it works for different window sizes. Base it off of momentum.
