# todolist
Basic web extension for google chrome that changes your default new tab to have a decent to do list. 

The only thing that I can really even think of thats left to do is use more wallpapers. That is literally it. 

To Do:
4. Change how the check box looks when its checked off to look more like momentum
6. Getting the x icon working, and have that be labeled "finished" tasks and the garbage ones actually being deleted. 
10. Make overdue tasks red and in "due today" 
12.
