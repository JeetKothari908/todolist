# todolist
Basic web extension for google chrome that changes your default new tab to have a decent to do list. 

The only thing that I can really even think of thats left to do is use more wallpapers. That is literally it. 

To Do:
1. Fix the dynamic sizing
3. Use more wallpapers
4. Change how the check box looks when its checked off to look more like momentum
5. Add a "finished" tasks, and along with, find some way of adding instanced of finished "repeated" tasks. With this list, there should be a "undo" button, that once pressed, readds the item to the list.
