# todolist
Basic web extension for google chrome that changes your default new tab to have a decent to do list. 

The only thing that I can really even think of thats left to do is use more wallpapers. That is literally it. 

To Do:
1. Fix the menu for items in the middle of lists, as that isn't
showing up properly.
2. Create the functionality behind how repeated tasks work
3. Use more wallpapers
4. Change how the check box looks when its checked off to look more like momentum
